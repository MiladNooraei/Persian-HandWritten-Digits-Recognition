#  Persian HandWritten Digits Recognition

This project showcases a comprehensive [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmahdiabbootalebi/persian-handwritten-digits?resource=download) sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), comprising 150,000 images capturing the beauty and diversity of Persian digits from 0 to 9. Each class is represented by 15,000 meticulously generated images, utilizing cutting-edge Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for a realistic visual experience.

I've implemented two powerful models for digit recognition. The first model employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, while the second utilizes a Neural Network (NN) for prediction. These models can take an input digit image, accurately label it, and determine its corresponding number. To enhance the user experience, I've integrated visualization capabilities using Matplotlib, allowing you to explore the original image alongside SVM and NN predictions.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
The first model, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, is a powerful tool for pattern recognition. SVM excels at accurately classifying input digit images, discerning their distinct features, and assigning them to the correct numeric label. This model's precision and efficiency make it an essential component of our digit recognition system.

### Neural Network (NN) Prediction
The second model leverages the capabilities of a Neural Network (NN) for prediction. NNs, inspired by the human brain, learn complex patterns and relationships within data. In this project, the NN excels at deciphering Persian HandWritten Digits, providing accurate predictions and contributing to the overall robustness of the recognition system.

### Visualization with Matplotlib
To enhance your exploration, i've integrated visualization capabilities using Matplotlib. This allows you to delve into the details of the digit recognition process. Visualize the original input image, compare it with the SVM and NN predictions, and gain insights into the models' decision-making processes.
